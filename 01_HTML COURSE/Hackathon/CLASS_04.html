    <h2>File Path System</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: The First Principle (The Fundamental Truth)</h3>
    <p>
      The most fundamental truth is this:
      <strong>A website is not one single file.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      It's a collection of different files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images,
      videos, fonts) that all need to work together. These files are organized
      into folders, just like documents on your computer.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 2: The Core Problem</h3>
    <p>
      If your <code>index.html</code> file needs to display an image named
      <code>logo.png</code>, how does the HTML file tell the browser where to
      <strong>find</strong> logo.png?
    </p>
    <p>
      You can't just say <code>src="logo.png"</code> and expect it to work every
      time. What if the logo is in an <code>images</code> folder? What if it's
      on a completely different website?
    </p>
    <p>
      The browser needs an exact, unambiguous address to locate the file.
      <strong>A file path is that address.</strong>
    </p>

    <h3>A Relative File Paths (The Most Important for Your Projects)</h3>
    <p>
      A relative file path gives directions to a file
      <strong
        >starting from the location of the file you are currently in</strong
      >. You will use this 99% of the time for linking your own files together
      (images, CSS, other HTML pages).
    </p>

    <h4>Scenario 1: Linking to a file in the SAME folder.</h4>
    <p>
      <strong>The Problem:</strong> You are in <code>index.html</code> and want
      to link to <code>about.html</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>The Logic:</strong> They are neighbors, living in the same
      <code>my-website/</code> folder.
    </p>
    <p><strong>The Syntax:</strong> You just use the filename.</p>

    <pre>
&lt;!-- This code is inside index.html --&gt;
&lt;a href="about.html"&gt;About Us&lt;/a&gt;
  </pre>

    <h4>Scenario 2: Linking to a file in a SUB-FOLDER (Going Down).</h4>
    <p>
      <strong>The Problem:</strong> You are in <code>index.html</code> and want
      to display <code>logo.png</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>The Logic:</strong> From <code>index.html</code>, you need to go
      <em>into</em> the <code>images</code> folder to find the logo.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>The Syntax:</strong> You write the folder name, a forward slash
      <code>/</code>, and then the filename.
    </p>

    <pre>
&lt;!-- This code is inside index.html --&gt;
&lt;img src="images/logo.png" alt="My Website Logo"&gt;
  </pre>

    <h4>Scenario 3: Linking to a file in a PARENT FOLDER (Going Up).</h4>
    <p>
      <strong>The Problem:</strong> You are in <code>contact.html</code> (inside
      <code>pages/</code>) and you want to display <code>logo.png</code> (inside
      <code>images/</code>).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>The Logic:</strong> You must first go <em>up</em> one level out of
      the <code>pages</code> folder to get back to the main
      <code>my-website/</code> folder. From there, you can go <em>down</em> into
      the <code>images</code> folder.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>The Syntax:</strong> Two dots and a slash (<code>../</code>) means
      "go up one level."
    </p>

    <pre>
&lt;!-- This code is inside pages/contact.html --&gt;
&lt;img src="../images/logo.png" alt="My Website Logo"&gt;
  </pre>

    <h3>B Absolute File Paths</h3>
    <p>
      An absolute file path gives the full, complete URL to a resource on the
      web. It starts with <code>http://</code> or <code>https://</code>.
    </p>

    <p><strong>When to use it:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        You ONLY use absolute paths when you are linking to a resource that is
        NOT on your own website.
      </li>
      <li>Linking to another website.</li>
      <li>Using a font from Google Fonts.</li>
      <li>Using an image from an image-hosting service.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
    <pre>
&lt;!-- Linking to an external website --&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.google.com"&gt;Search on Google&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;!-- Using an image hosted on another server --&gt;
&lt;img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6a/Html5_logo_and_wordmark.svg" alt="HTML5 Logo"&gt;
</pre>

    <h3>The Critical "Why": Why not use absolute paths for your own files?</h3>

    <p>
      A beginner might be tempted to copy the full path from their computer,
      like this:
    </p>

    <pre>
src="C:/Users/Arjun/Desktop/my-website/images/logo.png"
</pre>

    <p>
      <strong>This is a major mistake.</strong> This address only works on
      <em>your</em> computer. The moment you upload your website to a real web
      server, that path becomes meaningless and the image will be broken.
    </p>

    <p>
      Think of a web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, etc.) as a
      <strong>secure prison</strong> for the code it runs. This prison is called
      a <strong>"sandbox."</strong>
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>The Inmates:</strong> The HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code you
        load.
      </li>
      <li><strong>The Prison Walls:</strong> The browser itself.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The primary rule of this prison is:
      <strong
        >Code running inside the sandbox is NOT allowed to freely access the
        host computer's file system.</strong
      >
    </p>

    <h3>The Core Problem: A Malicious Website</h3>

    <p>
      Imagine if this security rule didn't exist. You could visit a malicious
      website,
      <em>evil-website.com</em>, and it could contain the following HTML:
    </p>

    <pre>
&lt;!-- Malicious code --&gt;
&lt;img src="C:/Users/Arjun/Documents/MyPrivatePasswords.txt"&gt;
</pre>

    <p>
      If the browser allowed this, the website could potentially read the
      contents of your private files, your photos, your documents—anything on
      your computer. It would be a catastrophic security disaster.
    </p>

    <p>
      Relative paths, however, will always work because they describe the
      location of files
      <em>relative to each other</em>, no matter what computer or server they
      are on.
    </p>

    <h3>Summary / Rules of Thumb</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong
          >For Your Own Files (Internal Links): ALWAYS use Relative
          Paths.</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>filename.html (Same folder)</li>
          <li>folder/filename.html (Go down)</li>
          <li>../filename.html (Go up)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong
          >For Other Websites' Files (External Links): ALWAYS use Absolute
          Paths.</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>https://www.example.com/page.html</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Absolute Path in Windows</h3>

    <p>
      The Windows file system is organized into separate drives, each identified
      by a letter (like <code>C:</code>, <code>D:</code>, etc.).
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Starting Point (The Root):</strong>
        An absolute path in Windows
        <strong>always starts with a drive letter</strong> followed by a colon
        and a backslash, like <code>C:\</code>. This is the "root" of that
        specific drive.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Directory Separator:</strong>
        Windows uses a <strong>backslash \</strong> to separate directories and
        files in the path.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Windows Structure:</h3>
    <p><code>Drive:\Folder\SubFolder\file.txt</code></p>

    <h3>Example:</h3>
    <p>
      Imagine a file named <code>report.docx</code> located in the
      <strong>Documents</strong> folder of a user named
      <strong>JohnDoe</strong> on the main <strong>C:</strong> drive.
    </p>

    <p>The absolute path would be:</p>
    <p><code>C:\Users\JohnDoe\Documents\report.docx</code></p>

    <p><strong>Let's break it down:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>C:\</code> - Start at the root of the C drive.</li>
      <li><strong>Users</strong> - Go into the "Users" folder.</li>
      <li><strong>JohnDoe</strong> - Go into the "JohnDoe" folder.</li>
      <li><strong>Documents</strong> - Go into the "Documents" folder.</li>
      <li><strong>report.docx</strong> - Here is the file.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Absolute Path in macOS (and Linux)</h3>

    <p>
      The macOS file system (like Linux and other Unix-like systems) does
      <strong>not</strong> use drive letters. Instead, it has a single, unified
      file system.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Starting Point (The Root):</strong> An absolute path in macOS
        <strong>always starts with a single forward slash /</strong>. This
        symbol represents the one and only root of the entire file system.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Directory Separator:</strong> macOS uses a
        <strong>forward slash /</strong> to separate directories and files.
        (This is the same separator used in web URLs, which is a helpful thing
        to remember).
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>macOS Structure:</h3>
    <p><code>/Folder/SubFolder/file.txt</code></p>

    <h3>Example:</h3>
    <p>
      Let's find the same file: <code>report.docx</code> in the
      <strong>Documents</strong> folder for the user <strong>johndoe</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>The absolute path would be:</p>
    <p><code>/Users/johndoe/Documents/report.docx</code></p>

    <p><strong>Let's break it down:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>/</code> - Start at the absolute root of the entire file system.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Users</strong> - Go into the "Users" directory.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>johndoe</strong> - Go into the "johndoe" directory (usernames
        are typically lowercase on macOS/Linux).
      </li>
      <li><strong>Documents</strong> - Go into the "Documents" directory.</li>
      <li><strong>report.docx</strong> - Here is the file.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>HTML Boilerplate Code</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: The First Principle (The Fundamental Truth)</h3>
    <p>
      The fundamental truth is that a web browser is a program that needs
      <strong>specific, predictable instructions</strong> to do its job. It
      cannot guess your intentions. You can't just give it a file with a
      <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tag and expect it to know what kind of document it
      is, what language it's in, or how to render it properly.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 2: The Core Problem</h3>
    <p>
      We need a way to give the browser essential "setup information"
      <em>before</em> it starts rendering our visible content (like paragraphs
      and images). This setup information needs to answer critical questions:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>"What version of HTML am I reading?"</strong> (So I know which
        rules to follow).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>"What character encoding should I use?"</strong> (So characters
        like ©, or ₹ are displayed correctly and not as gibberish like â€™).
      </li>
      <li><strong>"What should the title of the browser tab be?"</strong></li>
      <li>
        <strong
          >"How should this page behave on a mobile device vs. a
          desktop?"</strong
        >
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Just writing <code>&lt;p&gt;Hello&lt;/p&gt;</code> doesn't answer any of
      these questions.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 3: The Logical Solution - The Boilerplate</h3>

    <p>
      The solution is to create a standard, universal starting template — a
      <strong>boilerplate</strong>. This is a block of code that you will start
      every single HTML file with. It's not something you need to reinvent each
      time; you just copy-paste it and fill in the blanks.
    </p>

    <p>
      It's the "blueprint of the house" that you need before you can start
      putting in the walls (<code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>) and windows
      (<code>&lt;img&gt;</code>).
    </p>

    <p>Let's build the modern HTML5 boilerplate from first principles:</p>
    <hr />
    <h3>The Anatomy of the HTML Boilerplate</h3>

    <p><strong>Code Example:</strong></p>

    <pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;
    &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Document&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>

    <p>Let's break down each line and explain <em>why</em> it's necessary.</p>
    <h4>1. &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>The Problem:</strong> In the past, there were many versions of
        HTML (HTML4, XHTML, etc.). The browser needed to know which set of rules
        to use to render the page.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>The Solution:</strong> This is the very first line and it's
        called the <strong>Document Type Declaration</strong>. In modern HTML5,
        it's incredibly simple. This specific line tells the browser: "Use the
        latest, standard-compliant mode for rendering this HTML document." It
        prevents the browser from falling back into "quirks mode."
        <strong>It must always be the first thing in your file.</strong>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>2. &lt;html lang="en"&gt;...&lt;/html&gt;</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>The Problem:</strong> The web is global. How do search engines
        and screen readers know what human language the content is written in?
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>The Solution:</strong> This is the
        <strong>root element</strong> that wraps your entire page. The
        <code>lang="en"</code> attribute declares that the primary language of
        the page content is English. This is very important for accessibility
        and SEO.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>3. &lt;head&gt;...&lt;/head&gt;</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>The Problem:</strong> We need a place to put all the
        "behind-the-scenes" information for the browser, not for the user to
        see.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>The Solution:</strong> The <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section is
        the container for this metadata. Nothing inside
        <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> is shown in the main browser window.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>4. &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>The Problem:</strong> Computers only understand numbers. To
        display text, they use a "character set." If the browser uses the wrong
        one, text will be garbled.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>The Solution:</strong> This meta tag tells the browser to use
        <strong>UTF-8</strong>, the universal standard character set. It can
        represent almost any symbol from any language.
        <strong>This line prevents text-encoding issues.</strong>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>5. &lt;meta name="viewport" ...&gt;</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>The Problem:</strong> Websites are viewed on both tiny phones
        and giant monitors. Without guidance, mobile browsers render pages as
        desktops, making them tiny and unreadable.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>The Solution:</strong> This meta tag enables
        <strong>responsive design</strong>:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <code>width=device-width</code>: Sets page width equal to the device
            screen width.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>initial-scale=1.0</code>: Sets the initial zoom to 100%.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <strong>In simple terms:</strong> It tells the browser to optimize the
        page for mobile screens.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>6. &lt;title&gt;...&lt;/title&gt;</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>The Problem:</strong> With multiple tabs open, how do users
        identify your page? What text shows in bookmarks and search results?
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>The Solution:</strong> The <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> tag sets
        the text that appears in the browser tab, bookmarks, and search engine
        results. It's vital for usability and SEO.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>7. &lt;body&gt;...&lt;/body&gt;</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>The Problem:</strong> Where do we put visible content?</li>
      <li>
        <strong>The Solution:</strong> The <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> section
        contains everything the user sees: headings, paragraphs, images, links,
        tables, etc.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Conclusion:</h4>
    <p>
      The HTML boilerplate isn't random. Each line has a critical purpose to
      ensure your page is rendered correctly, accessible, mobile-friendly, and
      search-engine friendly. It is the
      <strong>non-negotiable starting point</strong> for every webpage you
      create.
    </p>
    <h2>But Website Works Even Without Boilerplate</h2>

    <h3>Browsers are Built to Be <strong>Extremely Forgiving</strong>.</h3>
    <p>
      In the early days of the web, it was a chaotic "Wild West." People wrote
      messy, incorrect, and incomplete HTML all the time. If browsers had been
      strict—crashing on a missing tag—the web would have never taken off.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, browser makers made a crucial decision:
      <strong>"When in doubt, guess."</strong>
    </p>

    <h3>The Core Problem: How to Handle "Bad" HTML?</h3>
    <p>
      A browser's job is to display <em>something</em>, no matter what you give
      it. When you give it a file without a boilerplate, here's what happens in
      the background:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>"No &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;? Hmm."</strong><br />
        The browser says: "I don't know what version of HTML this is. To be
        safe, I'll enter <strong>Quirks Mode</strong>." In quirks mode, the
        browser mimics very old, non-standard browsers. For simple
        <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, it looks fine, but for complex layouts it
        causes strange bugs.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong
          >"No &lt;html&gt; or &lt;body&gt; tags? I'll just pretend they're
          there."</strong
        ><br />
        The browser's parser is smart. If it sees <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, it
        knows it belongs in <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>. So it
        <strong>implicitly generates</strong> <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>,
        <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tags internally
        (in the DOM).
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong
          >"No &lt;meta charset=&quot;UTF-8&quot;&gt;? I'll guess the
          encoding."</strong
        ><br />
        The browser tries to guess character encoding. For plain English text,
        it usually works. But with special characters (€ — ''), if guessed wrong,
        text will break.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>"No &lt;title&gt;? Fine, I'll use the filename."</strong><br />
        The browser needs something in the tab. If <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> is
        missing, it simply uses the file name (e.g., <em>index.html</em>) as the
        title.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>So, Why Use a Boilerplate if the Browser Fixes Everything?</h3>

    <p>
      You're right that for a simple "Hello World" page, it <em>looks</em> the
      same. But the boilerplate isn't about making a simple page look right;
      it's about making a
      <strong>professional, reliable, and future-proof website.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>Here is why you're playing with fire by omitting it:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Unpredictable Rendering (Quirks Mode):</strong>
        Your CSS might work differently across Chrome, Firefox, and Safari
        because each browser has its own quirks mode. What looks fine on your
        machine might look broken elsewhere. Using
        <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code> forces browsers into
        <strong>Standards Mode</strong>, which is predictable.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Broken Characters:</strong>
        Your site may look fine until you add special characters like
        <code>50€</code> or <code>resumé</code>. Without
        <code>charset="UTF-8"</code>, these can break and make your site look
        unprofessional.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Bad Mobile Experience:</strong>
        Without the <code>&lt;meta name="viewport"&gt;</code> tag, your website
        will be almost unusable on mobile. It will appear as a tiny, zoomed-out
        desktop version.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Poor SEO and Accessibility:</strong>
        Search engines and screen readers rely on boilerplate tags like
        <code>lang</code> and <code>&lt;title&gt;</code>. Without them, your
        page becomes a "mystery document," ranking lower in search results and
        harder to navigate.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
    <p>
      You can build a shack with a few pieces of wood and no foundation, and it
      might stand up on a calm day. The boilerplate is the
      <strong>proper engineering foundation</strong>. It ensures your house
      (website) stands in any weather (any browser), is accessible to everyone
      (screen readers), is easy to find (SEO), and works on any size of land
      (any device).
    </p>
    <h2>Multipage Website</h2>

    <p>
      The fundamental truth is that complex information is almost never
      presented on a single, infinitely long page. We naturally break
      information into distinct, self-contained topics. A book has chapters, a
      store has departments, and a company has different aspects (About,
      Services, Contact).
    </p>

    <p>A multi-page website is the digital equivalent of this.</p>

    <h3>The Core Problem</h3>
    <p>
      We need a way to create these distinct topic pages and, most importantly,
      a way for a user to
      <strong>navigate between them seamlessly</strong>. How do we connect
      <code>home.html</code> to <code>about.html</code> and
      <code>contact.html</code>
      so that they feel like a single, cohesive "website" rather than three
      disconnected files?
    </p>

    <h3>The Logical Solution: A Shared Structure and a Navigation System</h3>
    <p>The solution involves two key components:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>A Consistent Structure:</strong>
        All pages on the site should share a common look and feel. They should
        have the same header (with the logo and navigation) and the same footer.
        This reassures the user that they are still on the same website.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>A Linking System:</strong>
        We need to use the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> (anchor) tag to create a
        navigation menu that appears on <em>every single page</em>, providing
        reliable doorways to all other pages.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>1. The &lt;div&gt; (The Generic Box)</h3>

    <h4>First Principle (The Fundamental Truth)</h4>
    <p>
      We need a way to group different elements (<code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>,
      <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>, etc.) together into a
      single, conceptual unit.
    </p>

    <h4>The Core Problem</h4>
    <p>
      Imagine you have a "user profile card" on a webpage. It consists of an
      image, a heading for the user's name, and a paragraph for their bio.
    </p>

    <pre>
&lt;img src="avatar.png"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Arjun Kumar&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loves to code and teach HTML.&lt;/p&gt;
</pre>

    <p>
      These are three separate elements. What if you want to put a border around
      <em>all three of them</em> as a single block? Or give them all a shared
      background color? Or move them all to the right side of the page as one
      unit? You have no way to target them as a group.
    </p>
    <h4>The Logical Solution: The Generic Container</h4>

    <p>
      The most basic solution is to invent a generic,
      <strong>meaningless</strong> container. Its only job is to be a box that
      you can put other things into. It shouldn't have any inherent meaning or
      style; it's just a grouping mechanism.
    </p>

    <p>This is the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> (short for "division").</p>

    <p>
      By wrapping our elements in a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, we create a single
      "box" that we can now control.
    </p>

    <pre>
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;img src="avatar.png"&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Arjun Kumar&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Loves to code and teach HTML.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>

    <p>
      Now, using CSS, we can say <em>"put a border on that &lt;div&gt;"</em>
      and it will wrap around the entire group.
    </p>

    <h3>2. class and id (The Labels for the Box)</h3>

    <h4>First Principle</h4>
    <p>
      Once we have boxes (<code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s), we need a way to identify
      and find them.
    </p>

    <h4>The Core Problem</h4>
    <p>
      Your webpage might have ten different profile cards, a sidebar, a main
      content area, and a photo gallery— all made of <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s.
      How do you tell the browser (specifically, your CSS or JavaScript) which
      box you want to style? How do you say,
      <em
        >"Make all the profile cards have a gray background, but make the one
        featured profile card have a gold border?"</em
      >
      You need a targeting system.
    </p>

    <h4>The Logical Solution: Two Types of Labels</h4>
    <p>
      The logical solution is to invent two types of labels (which we call
      <strong>attributes</strong>) that you can add to any HTML tag.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>A Unique Identifier:</strong> We need a label for one, and only
        one, specific element on the entire page. It must be unique. This is
        perfect for major, one-of-a-kind layout sections like the main
        navigation bar or a search form. This is the <strong>id</strong>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>A Reusable Classifier:</strong> We also need a label that we can
        apply to <em>multiple</em> elements to group them into a category. This
        is for things that have a similar style or function, like all the
        profile cards, all the error messages, or all the "buy now" buttons.
        This is the <strong>class</strong>.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Analogy:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>id</strong> is like a person's unique
        <em>Social Security Number or Aadhaar Number</em>. Only one person can
        have it.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>class</strong> is like a person’s <em>Job Title</em> (e.g.,
        "Engineer"). Many people in a company can have the class "Engineer".
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
    <pre>
&lt;!-- The one and only main header on the page --&gt;
&lt;div id="main-header"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;!-- A card that is special --&gt;
&lt;div id="featured-profile" class="profile-card"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;!-- A standard card --&gt;
&lt;div class="profile-card"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;!-- Another standard card --&gt;
&lt;div class="profile-card"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>

    <p>Now in CSS, you can target them:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>#main-header { ... }</code> → Targets the one unique element with
        that ID
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>.profile-card { ... }</code> → Targets ALL THREE elements with
        that class
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>#featured-profile { ... }</code> → Targets only the one special
        card to give it a gold border
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>3. The <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> (The Inline Highlighter)</h3>

    <h4>First Principle</h4>
    <p>
      Sometimes we need to label and style a piece of content <em>within</em> a
      line of text, without creating a new block.
    </p>

    <h4>The Core Problem</h4>
    <p>
      What if you want to make just a <em>single word</em> inside a paragraph
      red?
    </p>

    <p>This is very important information.</p>

    <p>
      You need to select the word <strong>"important"</strong>. If you wrap it
      in a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, it will create a line break, ruining the
      sentence:
    </p>

    <pre>
&lt;p&gt;This is very &lt;div&gt;important&lt;/div&gt; information.&lt;/p&gt;
</pre>

    <p><strong>→ Renders incorrectly.</strong></p>

    <h4>The Logical Solution: The Generic Inline Container</h4>
    <p>
      We need a container that works just like a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, but
      is <strong>inline</strong>, meaning it does <em>not</em> create a line
      break. It just wraps a small piece of content within the natural flow of
      the text.
    </p>

    <p>This is the <strong>&lt;span&gt;</strong>.</p>

    <pre>
&lt;p&gt;This is very &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;important&lt;/span&gt; information.&lt;/p&gt;
</pre>

    <p>
      Now you can use CSS to target the <code>.highlight</code> class and make
      that one word red, without affecting the layout of the paragraph.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Analogy:</strong> A <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> is like using a
      <strong>highlighter pen</strong>. You can mark a few words in a book
      without having to rip out the page and put it in a separate box.
    </p>

    <h4>Other Semantic Containers</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>&lt;header&gt;</strong>: The box for the introductory content at
        the top of your page or a section. It typically contains your logo, site
        navigation (<code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>), and main heading.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>&lt;footer&gt;</strong>: The box for the closing content at the
        bottom. It usually contains copyright info, contact details, and
        secondary links.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>&lt;main&gt;</strong>: Defines the
        <strong>main, unique content</strong> of that specific page. It should
        not contain things that are repeated on every page (like the header or
        footer). There should only be <strong>one</strong>
        <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> tag per page.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <img src="Images/class_4-content-img.svg" width="700px" alt="summary image" />
